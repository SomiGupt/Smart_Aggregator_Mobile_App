This is my (Somil Gupta's) mobile app code

The Screens are contained in the Screens Folder

The navigator (used for navigation between screens and bottom tab navigation) is held in the Navigators Folder

My Component (used x amount of times by the user in the SavedSearches Screen) is held in Components

To run this code you will need to download all the dependencies held in the Package.json file (likely after installing and using Node.js package manager)

Once you have this done you can run the code using the command "npx expo start"

You can then use the ExpoGo app on an an iphone (or android) and scan the QR code to open it in the app or you can use an Android (or Iphone if you have one) emulator
